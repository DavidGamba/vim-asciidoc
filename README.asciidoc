vim-asciidoc
------------

__Enhanced editing support for Asciidoc files in Vim__

Lists
~~~~~

Nested bullet and number lists are supported using the following syntax:
----
* item
** sub-item
*** sub-sub-item
----

And numbered lists:
----
. item
.. sub-item
... sub-sub-item
----

Reformatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Vim does the wrong thing by reformatting Asciidoc's block
delimiters as part of the paragraph. The vim-asciidoc plugin fixes
that problem, correctly formatting blocks, lists and normal
paragraphs.

NOTE: This is a work in progress and not all things work as expected yet.

vim-asciidoc also provides better reformatting of lists.

Syntax Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

vim-asciidoc merely bundles Stuart Rackham's original asciidoc syntax file.

Snippets
~~~~~~~~

vim-asciidoc provides several convenient snippets in the snipmate format.
